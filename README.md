# Myntra-Product-Data

# Product Discount and Rating Analysis

This project aims to analyze the product data, including information on discounts, ratings, and reviews. We perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to gain insights into the relationship between price discounts, customer ratings, and sales. The final report is presented using a Power BI dashboard.

## Steps Involved:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw data is cleaned, with missing values handled and incorrect data types fixed.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We performed descriptive analysis and visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features such as discount percentages were created for further analysis.
4. **Power BI Dashboard**: The analysis is visualized using Power BI to create interactive dashboards.

## Required Libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- plotly
- Power BI (for dashboard creation)

## Instructions to Run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries:
3. Run the scripts in the following order:
- `data_cleaning.py`
- `data_analysis.py`
- `feature_engineering.py` (if applicable)

4. The processed data will be saved as `processed_data.csv` in the `data` directory.
5. Open the Power BI file `final_dashboard.pbix` for the visualized dashboard.
